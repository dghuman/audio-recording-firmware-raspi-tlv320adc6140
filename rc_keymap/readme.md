## Keymaps for the IR remote

Keymap file that is configured for the RC6 (Microsoft) code.  I changed the the POWER button keyname from "KEY_SLEEP" to "KEY_POWER" and this now triggers the Pi to shut down. I also changed the INPUT button "KEY_PVR" to "KEY_WLAN" to make it clearer that this key turns on wifi. I will use the EXIT button "KEY_EXIT" as it is to shut off the wifi.
